BB Biodiversity Dashboard

This project used JavaScript, Plotly.JS, Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Flask to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. I read the data from CSV files using Pandas. I then built three graphs using Plotly and Javascript. The pie chart shows the top ten samples for a particular sample id. The bubble chart shows all the samples and OTU ID data points. Metadata for the sample is also displayed, along with a gauge chart for washing frequency. The graphs resize when the page size is modified.
